# Positivus Landing Page Design Template (React)

Welcome to the Positivus Landing Page Design Template! This is a modern, responsive React implementation of a digital marketing agency landing page. If you were expecting old-school HTML, toh bhool jao! (Forget it!) This repo is all about React swag and clean code.

## 🚀 Features
- Fully component-based React architecture
- Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Modern CSS (no inline style ka kachra)
- Easy to customize and extend

## 📁 Project Structure

├── public/           # Recursos estáticos
├── assets/           # Arquivos de imagens e outros recursos
```

## 🖼️ Assets
Put all images in `src/images/`. If you forget, toh image nahi dikhega, samjhe? (You won't see the image, got it?)

## 🤦 Common Mistakes (Don't be that guy)
- Don't commit `node_modules` (warna repo ka size Mount Everest ho jayega)
- Don't forget to update `.env` for secrets (if you add any)
- Don't touch the CSS unless you know what you're doing (warna design ka band baj jayega)
